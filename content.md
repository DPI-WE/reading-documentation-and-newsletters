# Reading Documentation and Newsletters
In this lesson, you will explore the importance of reading documentation and subscribing to relevant newsletters. These resources are crucial for staying up-to-date with best practices, learning new techniques, and troubleshooting issues effectively.

## Exploring Documentation
### Rails Guides
The [Rails Guides](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/) are a terrific resource, and you now have the vocabulary to understand the gist of most of them. Some essential guides to start with include:

- [Getting Started with Rails](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html): An introduction to Rails for beginners.
- [Active Record Basics](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html): Understanding how to interact with the database using Active Record.
- [Routing Guide](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html): Learn how to define routes in a Rails application.
- [Action Controller Overview](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_controller_overview.html): An overview of how controllers work in Rails.
- [Active Record Validations](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations.html): How to ensure data integrity with validations.

For example, I feel like I learn something new every time I read the [Routing Guide](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html).

## How to Use Documentation
Peruse through the Rails Guides. You don't have to read them word for word, but get a sense of what's in there so that it rings a bell when you run into a use case. Here are some steps to effectively use documentation:

- **Skim through the Table of Contents**: Get an overview of what topics are covered.
- **Bookmark Important Sections**: Mark sections that seem particularly relevant or interesting.
- **Take Notes**: Write down any key points or examples that stand out to you.
- **Think of Questions**: As you read, think of questions to discuss next time or post them on Ask.
- **Reference the Correct Version**: Always make sure the version you are using is the same as the documentation.

## Additional Documentation Resources

- [API Documentation for Rails](https://api.rubyonrails.org/): Detailed API documentation for Ruby on Rails.
